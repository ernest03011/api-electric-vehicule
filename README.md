# Electric Vehicle Population API

This is a simple RESTful API to manage electric vehicle data imported from a CSV file.

## üìÇ About the API

The API uses data from the `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` file. This data should be imported into a database table named:

- electric_vehicle_population_data

### üîß Setup

1. Import the `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` into a database table called `electric_vehicle_population_data`.

2. In the project root, create a `.env` file using the provided `.env-example` as a reference.

3. The default development server runs at `localhost:8080`. If you'd like to change it (e.g., to `vehicle.domain.com/api/`), update the `.htaccess` file in the root directory by replacing `localhost:8080` with your desired domain.
